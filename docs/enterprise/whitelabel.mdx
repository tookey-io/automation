Our white labeling feature is designed for SaaS companies and agencies seeking to integrate Activepieces seamlessly into their offerings while maintaining a consistent brand identity.

## Key Features

When you opt for our white labeling option, you gain access to all the features available in the **cloud edition**, along with the following exciting additions:

1. **Custom Branding:** Tailor the appearance of the software to align with your brand's identity by selecting your own branding colors and fonts.

2. **Piece Management:** Take full control over Activepieces pieces. You can show or hide existing pieces and create your own unique pieces to customize the platform according to your specific needs.

3. **User Authentication Management:** Seamlessly manage user access and permissions by integrating your existing users and teams, granting them the appropriate level of access to Activepieces.

4. **Template Management:** Control prebuilt templates and add your own unique templates to meet the requirements of your users.

5. **Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration:** Easily integrate your existing authentication system; we support all Single Sign-On (SSO) providers in Workkos (https://workos.com/docs/integrations).

6. **Private Pieces:** Create private pieces exclusive to your organization without sharing them with the community or public npmjs. However, publishing pieces to public npmjs is available for all users in the cloud and open-source.

7. **Audit Log:** Gain the ability to audit all actions taken by users within the platform for enhanced security and compliance.
