<Warning>
This feature is not yet complete and will be released under the enterprise edition. Please contact sales@activepieces.com if this is required for you. ðŸš§
</Warning>

<Tip>
This feature is currently being developed closely with existing customers. We would love to hear your thoughts and usecase. 

Feel free to book a meeting with the CTO for technical discussions from https://cal.com/abuaboud.

The objective of using environments:

- **Version Control & External Storage:** Maintain complete version history in Git, in addition to the one in Activepieces that showcases all deployments.
- **CI / CD:** Automate deployment to Activepieces by leveraging your Git-based provider (Github Actions / GitLab).
- **Compliance and Auditability:** manage access to build, test, and deploy automations with complete audit trail.
- **Low-Code User Friendly:** Utilize a standard Git-based repository with direct visual interaction from activepieces interface.

## How It Works:

This feature utilizes Git for external storage, version control, and CI/CD capabilities. Before starting, the following requirements are necessary.

**Requirements:**

- Production and Development branches and path inside the Git-based repository.
- Two Projects in Activepieces: one for Development and one for Production.

The development workflow will resemble the following:

**Step One: Make Changes in Development Project**

The development team will implement changes within the development project. Once completed, they'll select the flows and visually push them to the Git development branch from Activepieces interface, requiring no Git knowledge.

<Note>
If conflicts occur, Activepieces will be accepted changes, overriding changes in Git.
</Note>

The following will be pushed in JSON format:
- Credentials (Name / Type) only.
- Workflows.

**Step Two: Open Pull Request (Optional)**

In Github/GitLab or your Git-based provider, you can open a pull request from the development branch toward the production branch. Once it receives the necessary approval, proceed to merge it.

<Tip> 
If no approval or reviews are required, you can push directly to the production branch from activepieces to trigger CI/CD.
</Tip>

**Step Three: Automate Deployment to Production Project**

The production project in **Activepieces** will automate pulling from the production branch in **Git**. It will synchronize the exact state from the **Git**-based branch to your **Activepieces** project.

The CI/CD expects all credentials to exist with the same name and type; otherwise, the pull will fail, providing a proper error indicating missing connections.

<Note>
If there's a conflict, Git will be the source of truth.
