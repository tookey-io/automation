<ResponseField name="Api Key" required type="Secret_text">

Follow these instructions to get your OpenAI API Key:

1. Visit the following website: `https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.`
2. Once on the website, locate and click on the option to obtain your OpenAI API Key.

It is strongly recommended that you add your credit card information to your OpenAI account and upgrade to the paid plan **before** generating the API Key. This will help you prevent 429 errors.

</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Question" required type="Long_text">
The question to ask OpenAI.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Model"  type="Static_dropdown">
The model which will generate the completion. Some models are suitable for natural language tasks, others specialize in code.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Temperature"  type="Number">
Controls randomness: Lowering results in less random completions. As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Maximum Tokens"  type="Number">
The maximum number of tokens to generate. Requests can use up to 2,048 or 4,096 tokens shared between prompt and completion, don't set the value to maximum and leave some tokens for the input. The exact limit varies by model. (One token is roughly 4 characters for normal English text)
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Top P"  type="Number">
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Frequency penalty"  type="Number">
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Presence penalty"  type="Number">
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the mode's likelihood to talk about new topics.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Roles"  type="Json">
Array of roles to specify more accurate response
