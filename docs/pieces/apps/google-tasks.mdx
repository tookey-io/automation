## Set up and run an app that calls a Google Tasks API.

1. In the Google Cloud console, enable the Google Tasks API.
    - Navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (make sure you are on the desired project or create a new project if you have none).
    - Navigate to **APIs & Services**.
    - Navigate to **Library** from the sidemenu.
    - Find and enable the **Tasks API**.
2. Click In the Google Cloud console, and go to Menu menu > APIs & Services > Credentials.
3. Click Create Credentials > OAuth client ID.
4. In the Name field, type a name for the credential. This name is only shown in the Google Cloud console.
5. Click Create. The OAuth client created screen appears, showing your new Client ID and Client secret. Make sure to copy them before closing.
6. Click OK. The newly created credential appears under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs.
