This utility helps you map outputs of steps to a specific JSON object of your design.
Example:
if you have step_1 and its output is :

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

and you want to use "firstName" and "lastName" to create "name" in a new object, you can input this to the mapping input:

```json
{
    "name": "{{step_1.firstName}} {{step_1.lastName}}"
}
```

This would be resolved to:

```json
{
    "name": "John Smith"
}
```
<Warning>If you pass in an object it will be resolved to an object even though it is passed as 
a string like "\{\{step_1}\}".
If there is any string next to it, the object will be stringified and concatenated.</Warning>
