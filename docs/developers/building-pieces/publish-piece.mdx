Learn two methods to publish your piece, depending on your needs. The first option benefits the community.

## Method 1: Contribute Your Piece Back

To make your piece public, follow these steps:

1. Open a pull request:
   - Build and test your piece.
   - Open a pull request from your repository to the main fork.
   - A maintainer will review your work closely.

2. Merge the pull request:
   - Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
   - Your piece will be available within a few minutes.
   - An automatic GitHub action will package it and create an npm package on npmjs.com.

## Method 2: Publish to NPM Directly (Unofficial Piece)

You can publish the piece as an npm package directly by following these steps:

1. Run the following command line:

### Step 1:

Make sure you are logged in to npm. If not, please run:
```bash
npm login
```

### Step 2:

Rename the piece name in `package.json` to something unique or related to your organization's scope (Ex: `@my-org/piece-PIECE_NAME`). You can find it at `packages/pieces/PIECE_NAME/package.json`.

<Tip>
Don't forget to increase the version number in `package.json` for each new release.
</Tip>


### Step 3:

<Tip>
Replace `PIECE_NAME` with the actual name of your piece.
</Tip>

Run the following command:
```bash
npm run publish-piece PIECE_NAME
```

**Congratulations! You can now import the piece from the settings page.**
