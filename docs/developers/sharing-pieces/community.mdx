You can publish your pieces to npm registry and share them with the community, users can install your piece from Settings -> My Pieces -> Install Piece -> type in the name of your piece package.

**1. Login to npm**

Make sure you are logged in to npm. If not, please run:
```bash
npm login
```

**2. Rename Piece**

Rename the piece name in `package.json` to something unique or related to your organization's scope (Ex: `@my-org/piece-PIECE_NAME`). You can find it at `packages/pieces/PIECE_NAME/package.json`.

<Tip>
Don't forget to increase the version number in `package.json` for each new release.
</Tip>


**3. Publish**

<Tip>
Replace `PIECE_NAME` with the actual name of your piece.
</Tip>

Run the following command:
```bash
npm run publish-piece PIECE_NAME
```

**Congratulations! You can now import the piece from the settings page.**
