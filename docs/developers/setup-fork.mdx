The first step to modify a repository is to fork it. Forking a repository creates a copy of the repository on your account.

<Tip>
**Friendly Tip #1:** For experimentation, fork or clone the public repository. For enterprise production, fork the private one.
</Tip>

## Create a Public Fork (Community Users)

Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner of the repository page (https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces)

## Create a Private Fork (Enterprise Users)

<Tip>
Private forks are valuable for enterprise users seeking to establish private repositories for their organization's use.
</Tip>

By following these steps, you can create a private fork on GitHub, GitLab or another platform and configure the "activepieces" repository as the upstream source, allowing you to incorporate changes from the "activepieces" repository.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

Begin by creating a bare clone of the repository. Remember that this is a temporary step and will be deleted later.

```bash
git clone --bare git@github.com:activepieces/activepieces.git
 ```

2. **Create a Private Git Repository**

Generate a new private repository on GitHub or your chosen platform. When initializing the new repository, do not include a README, license, or gitignore files. This precaution is essential to avoid merge conflicts when synchronizing your fork with the original repository.
   
3. **Mirror-Push to the Private Repository:**

Mirror-push the bare clone you created earlier to your newly created "activepieces" repository. Make sure to replace `<your_username>` in the URL below with your actual GitHub username.

```bash
cd activepieces.git
git push --mirror git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git
```

4. **Remove the Temporary Local Repository:**
  
```bash
cd ..
rm -rf activepieces.git
```

5. **Clone Your Private Repository:**

Now, you can clone your "activepieces" repository onto your local machine into your desired directory.

```bash
cd ~/path/to/directory
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git
```

6. **Add the Original Repository as a Remote:**

If desired, you can add the original repository as a remote to fetch potential future changes. However, remember to disable push operations for this remote, as you are not permitted to push changes to it.

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:activepieces/activepieces.git
git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
```

You can view a list of all your remotes using `git remote -v`. It should resemble the following:

```
origin	git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:activepieces/activepieces.git (fetch)
upstream	DISABLE (push)
```

> When pushing changes, always use `git push origin`.

### Sync Your Fork

To retrieve changes from the "upstream" repository, fetch the remote and rebase your work on top of it.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Conflict resolution should not be necessary since you've only added pieces to your repository.
