**Functional Requirements:**
* Execute NodeJS code from code editor for test purposes.
* Download npm packages and bundle them into single JS file.

**Terminology:**
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): tool to bundle javascript projects into single file.
* [Isolate](https://github.com/ioi/isolate): creates a lightweight sandboxes locally.

## Detailed Design

### Code Builder

All codes are written by user are unbundled (package.json and index.js),
after installing the dependencies `node_modules` size grows so fast while the code only use small parts of it.

The goal to use webpack to bundle only used code into single javascript file, to do that we do following.

1. Call `isolate` to create sandbox folder locally.
2. Copy the code with webpack configs inside the sandbox.
3. Call `npm install` securely with `isolate`.
4. Call `npm run build` and fetch the bundled js.

### Code Runner

When users want to test NodeJS code written on activepieces code editor, the code runner do the following.

1. Call `isolate` to create sandbox folder locally.
2. Copy the code inside the sandbox.
3. Call `node CODE_FILE.js` securely using isolate and fetch the results.
