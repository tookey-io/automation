title: "Repository Structure"
description: ""
---

The repository is structured as a monorepo using the NX build system, with TypeScript as the primary language. It is divided into several packages:

```
.
├── packages
│   ├── ui
│   ├── backend
│   ├── engine
│   ├── pieces
│   ├── shared

```

- `ui`: This package contains the user interface, implemented using the Angular framework.
- `backend`: This package contains the API implementation, using the Fastify framework.
- `engine`: This package contains the logic for flow execution within the sandbox.
- `pieces`: This package contains the implementation of triggers and actions for third-party apps.
- `shared`: This package contains shared data models and helper functions used by the other packages.
