Semantic versioning is a standardized way of versioning software projects. It uses a three-part version number in the format `X.Y.Z`, where:

**X** is the major version number, which is incremented for significant or breaking changes to the software.<br />
**Y** is the minor version number, which is incremented for new features or functionality that is backwards-compatible with the previous version.<br />
**Z** is the patch number, which is incremented for bug fixes and other small changes that do not add new features or break backwards compatibility.

<Note>You will only see Version X.Y here as all Patch changes (Z) are added under their minor versions.</Note>
