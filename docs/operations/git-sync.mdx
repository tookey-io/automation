The Git Sync feature allows for the creation of an **external backup**, **environments**, and maintaining a **version history**.


### How It Works:

This example explains a simple setup for creating development and production environments. The setup can be extended to include multiple environments and multiple Git branches.

**Requirements:**
- Empty Git Repository
- Two Projects in Activepieces: one for Development and one for Production.

#### 1. Push to the repository

After making changes in the development project, you can click on the "Push to Repository" button on the Git Sync page in Activepieces to push the changes to the repository.

All flows in the Git Repository will be replaced with the ones in the Project.

#### 2. Pull from the repository
<Note>
Please note that the credentials will not be synced automatically. You should manually create the same credentials in both environments.
</Note>

You can trigger a pull from the Git Repository button in Activepeces, then all flows in the project will be replaced with the ones in the git repository.

#### Approval Workflow (Optional)

To manage your approval workflow, you can use Git by creating two branches: development and production. Then, you can use standard pull requests as the approval step.
