### Access by Path

If you come across a step that has a property not available in the auto-complete interface, you can use the json path, the json path starts with step slug.
 
The step slug is a short text identifier for the step, like "trigger" or "step_1," which can be found by hovering over the step. 

To access a specific property, you can type `{{step_slug.path_to_property}}` in order to resolve the path.
