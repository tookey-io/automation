This tutorial will show how to use user connections inside the pieces.

In this example we will write a flow that will send a notifcation for user slack channel

The flow consists of three steps:

1. The trigger will be webhook, an example payload:

```json
{
    "body": {
        "user": "USER_ID",
        "channel": "general",
        "message" : "Message"
    }
}
```

2. The second step is to fetch the connection information, the connection name is in format `slack_USERID`, so we add `slack_` and the user from webhook body.
