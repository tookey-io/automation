## Overview

The Code piece is where you can write your custom code. It maximizes flexibility as you can write code to achieve things you can't with the predefined pieces.

This piece currently supports writing code in **Typescript**, you can also bring in your favorite **npm packages** by clicking on the fullscreen button and **Add npm package***.

This is how the settings of this piece will look when you add it to your flow:

## Use cases

You can do almost anything you do with regular code. For example:

- Use a package to process a CSV file and parse it as a JSON array.
- Reformat output from previous steps to a different format expected by the following pieces.
- Filter outputs from previous steps by a custom criteria.

## Instructions

As you see in the screenshot of the step settings above, you can configure the Code piece as follows:

### Parameters

To use outputs from previous steps in your code, you have to pass them through the Parameters input.

Parameters are key/value pairs. The **key** you define here will become available in your code as a property of the `inputs` argument in the main function.

For example, if you pass `mode` as a **key** and `full` as a **value**, you can access this parameter by `inputs.mode` and its value will be `full`.

The parameters become powerful when you pass outputs from previous steps.

## Fullscreen 

You can go to fullscreen to add npm packages and have a better coding and testing experience by clicking the fullscreen button.
