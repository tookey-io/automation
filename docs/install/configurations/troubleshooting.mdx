## Queue Board (Redis Only)

The queue board is a tool that allows you to check runs for issues. It's accessible when you're using Redis as the queue system. In production mode, you can access it at `/api/ui`, and in development mode, it's located at `/ui.`

To enable it, you can set an environment variable and secure it with basic authentication. For more details, please refer to the Environment Variables.

## Reset Password

If you forgot your password on self hosted instance, you can reset it using the following steps:

#### Postgres

1. **Locate PostgreSQL Docker Container**:
   - Use a command like `docker ps` to find the PostgreSQL container.

2. **Access the Container**:
   - Use SSH to access the PostgreSQL Docker container.
   ```bash
   docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
   ```

3. **Open the PostgreSQL Console**:
   - Inside the container, open the PostgreSQL console with the `psql` command.
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```

4. **Create a Secure Password**:
   - Use a tool like [bcrypt.online](https://bcrypt.online/) to generate a new secure password, number of rounds is 10.

5. **Update Your Password**:
   - Run the following SQL query within the PostgreSQL console, replacing `HASH_PASSWORD` with your new password and `YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with your email.
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.user SET password='HASH_PASSWORD' WHERE email='YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS';
   ```

#### SQLite3

1. **Open the SQLite3 Shell**:
   - Access the SQLite3 database by opening the SQLite3 shell. Replace "database.db" with the actual name of your SQLite3 database file if it's different.
   ```bash
   sqlite3 ~/.activepieces/database.sqlite3
   ```

2. **Create a Secure Password**:
   - Use a tool like [bcrypt.online](https://bcrypt.online/) to generate a new secure password, number of rounds is 10.


3. **Reset Your Password**:
   - Once inside the SQLite3 shell, you can update your password with an SQL query. Replace `HASH_PASSWORD` with your new password and `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username or email.
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET password = 'HASH_PASSWORD' WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS';
   ```

4. **Exit the SQLite3 Shell**:
   - After making the changes, exit the SQLite3 shell by typing:
   ```bash
   .exit
   ```
