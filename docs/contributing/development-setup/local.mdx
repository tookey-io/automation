**Troubleshoot 1:**
The IP address 0.0.0.0:5432 is already in use. This suggests that another PostgreSQL on your device is currently active, leading to a port conflict.

## Pieces development

To avoid making the dev environment slow, not all pieces are functional during development at first. By default, only
theses pieces are functional at first:
- delay
- discord
- github
- hackernews
- slack
- store

Any other piece become functional after any edit in its code.

To override the default list available at first, define a `AP_DEV_PIECES` env var with a comma-separated list of pieces
to make available. For example, to make `google-sheets` and `cal-com` available you can use
```sh
AP_DEV_PIECES=google-sheets,cal-com npm start
```
