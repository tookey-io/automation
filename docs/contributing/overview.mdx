Welcome to the Activepieces project! We appreciate and welcome contributions from developers, designers, users, and anyone with suggestions for improvement. Here's how you can get involved:

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to the Activepieces project:

- Report bugs or request new features by opening an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/issues).
- Suggest improvements or report documentation issues by opening an issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/issues).

## Building Pieces

Building new [pieces](https://github.com/orgs/activepieces/projects/5/views/1) is crucial for the growth of the project. If you're interested in building a piece, follow the overview below.

### Step 1: Development Setup

To set up the development environment, you can choose one of the following methods:

- **Codespaces**: This is the quickest way to set up the development environment. Follow the [Codespaces](./development-setup/codespaces) guide.
- **Local Environment**: It is recommended for local development. Follow the [Local Environment](./development-setup/local) guide.
- **Dev Container**: This method is suitable for remote development on another machine. Follow the [Dev Container](./development-setup/dev-container) guide.

### Step 2: Create Your First Action

Follow the [Create Action & Piece](building-pieces/create-action) guide to create your first action.

### Step 3: Create Your First Trigger

Creating a trigger is slightly more challenging than creating an action due to various methods involved. Learn more about it from the [Triggers](building-pieces/triggers) guide.

# Contribute Your Piece

To make your piece public, follow these steps:

1. **Open a pull request:**
   - Build and test your piece.
